## Project description 🧠💪

This project is a cutting-edge Smart AI Communication Platform designed to generate personalized, context-aware emails by intelligently analyzing previous text conversations between users. The platform leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to understand the tone, relationship dynamics, and communication style of the user, ensuring that the generated emails align naturally with past interactions.

By reading and learning from prior chat logs, email threads, or messaging app data, the AI can craft responses or initiate email drafts that sound authentic, maintain conversational flow, and reflect the user's intent without requiring manual effort. This significantly streamlines professional and personal correspondence, saving time while preserving a personal touch in communication.

This project was made for IBM watson Hackathon using ibm granite model and running on slack api in the "make work less boring" track
